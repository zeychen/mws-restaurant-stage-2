## Restaurant Reviews Stage 2
### Project Overview
This project is the continuation of Restaurant Reviews Stage 1 by taking the responsive, accessible design built in Stage One and connect it to an external server. It uses asynchronous JavaScript to request JSON data from the server. Store data received from the server in an offline database using IndexedDB, which will create an app shell architecture. Finally, the site is optimized to meet performance benchmarks tested using Lighthouse.
